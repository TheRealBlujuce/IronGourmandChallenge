Allied Race Rules:

If using an Allied Race, you must vendor all gear you are wearing and purchase white starting gear. 
You must start your journey going to your racial zone (Zuldazar for Zandalari, Durotar for Mag'har, Dun'morough for Dark Iron Dwarfs, etc). 
You must complete the cooking/fishing achievements of that zone, and then start from the beginning. So if your race takes you back to Zandalar or Kul'tiras, you would do Zandalari/Kultiran cooking/fishing first, then move on to classic, cataclysm, northrend, pandaria, etc.
